Shall I open fire, General?
Step back, GI Robot,
and keep mum.
The Bride and Nina are inside.
- They're not moving.
- [grunting]
So, they've almost certainly
been captured
by Circe and
the Sons of Themyscira.
Once the enemy
is in your sights, attack,
and don't stop until they're
all dead or incapacitated
[high-pitched ringing]
You gettin' the hang of this,
Tin Man?
Most certainly, sir.
Good. Me and Easy
been through this
more than a few times.
Just follow our lead.
German forces shouldn't be
too far up ahead.
We just need to take 'em
by surpri
[twig breaking]
Sure Shot, you got eyes?
Just arrived
at the crescent, sir.
Let me
Sergeant, get out of there!
Now!
Fall back!

Cheers to the Tin Man!

[window shattering]

- What the hell?
[muffled yelling]
It's a trap of some sort!
[Weasel exclaims]
[muffled yelling]
What? Point your head, woman.
Where are they?
[speaking indistinctly]
- [ripping]
- [wincing]
- Where are they?
- They're gone!
Circe and
the Sons of Themyscira?
- Yes!
- [Flag] They're gone?
[The Bride] That's what I said!
- Then why were you screaming?
- I wanted you to get
the damn tape off my mouth!
[GI Robot]
Where is friend Nina?
They took her upstairs
before they left.
What are you doing out here?
We thought we were
recruiting monsters,
not damsels in distress!
Nina!
[Nina screaming]
I'm in here, help!
GI!
Friend Nina,
my disappointment in having
no Nazis to kill when I arrived
is lessened by my pleasure
that you are alive.
[Nina chuckling]
Hello.
I can't stay out of the water.
The helmet on my suit
was shattered,
and I can't breathe without it.
But I have a spare
back at the castle.
Do not worry, friend Nina.
[bathtub rumbling]
[breaking]
[sizzling]
[shattering]
[Flag] Circe and the Sons.
They attacked you,
and then, they just
left you here alive?
Why would they do
- Uh-oh.
- Everyone!
Back to the castle now!
- [door opens]
- [all gasping]
General, I didn't wanna come.
I followed her here, I
That doesn't matter now!
Move, Alexi.
Get us back to the castle.
Circe led us here on purpose.
She wanted us to be
away from the castle
so she could get
to the princess.
[Alexi] Oh, ne!
[host] The United States
is home
to the greatest minds
in the world,
and that is an
absolute certainty.
Now, how do I know?
Well, let's just say
the proof is in the pudding,
and the pudding,
ladies and gentlemen,
is my next guest, GI Robot!
[audience cheering]
Why am I pudding?
Go, go!
[orchestral music playing]
[cheering continues]
This incredible
mechanical soldier
is the product of the greatest
scientists in the US Army.
GI Robot is a killing machine
who took down over 1,000
enemy troops in the war.
- [audience gasping]
- [scattered applauding]
[computer beeping]
Do you see something
interesting out there, GI?
Can I call you GI?
You just did call me GI.
- [all laughing]
- Yes, I did, didn't I?
Have you checked all these
people's identification cards?
[laughs] No,
we haven't done that.
Why would we have
done that, GI?
To see if are any known Nazis.
If so, they will be
dispatched of,
in short order.
[audience murmuring]
[chuckles] Well, I don't think
there are any Nazis here.
That's what a Nazi would say.
Uh, what?
[laughs nervously]
[General King] As you can see,
the robot's personality
wasn't exactly built for
these kinds of publicity tours.
- [Magnus] AI system.
- What?
It's a term I prefer
over "robot."
I've always been fascinated
by the old film
of the subject in combat,
but I never realized
he seems to have some type
of vague self-awareness.
It's extraordinary.
The first of his type, really.
We're gonna retire it
from the stage,
but thought it could be of use
to you and your studies.
Indeed.
[whirring]
GI Robot, at attention, sir!
Well, hello.
I'm Dr. William Magnus,
a scientist and engineer.
My specialty
is artificial intelligence.
Are you a Nazi?
No. I'm not a Nazi.
[sighs] Oh.
Where is my body?
I'm just, uh, studying you.
I'll piece you
back together later,
perhaps with a few improvements
if I'm feeling generous.
You're truly remarkable work,
especially for 1943.
Are there Nazis nearby?
You're awful preoccupied
with Nazis.
I was created
with the sole mandate
to kill Nazis and their allies.
But do you want to kill Nazis?
What I want is irrelevant.
My directive
is all that matters.
But, if you, theoretically,
had no directive,
what is it that you desire?
Someday I'd like to be reunited
and see my boys.
Your boys?
The boys of Easy Company, sir.
And kill Nazis with them.
Have you seen them?
I have not.
The war was 20 years ago.
Sergeant Frank Rock, Bulldozer,
Little Sure Shot, Wildman,
Canary, Four-Eyes, Bogman?
Ring any bells? [dings]
Yeah, no. I don't know
who any of those people are.
But you, you are going
to help me a great deal.
To murder Nazis?
No, but studying you
will help me create
the next wave of automatons.

Gotcha! [grunts]

All right, what are we supposed
to do with her now?
The hell, dude.
The queen told us
a million times. Just kill her.
- [grunting]
- I mean, yeah, but, you know,
might be a shame not to have
a little taste firs
- [grunting]

[panting]
Dude, your face

I think you need

[knight] Here, madam,
your air suit.
What am I gonna do?
So you can help
in the battle [grunts]
Ugh!
[Sam] So, how'd you get
your mitts on it?
Oh, it It bounced around
from lab to lab,
from the '60s through the '90s.
They studied it, and got
what they could from it.
I guess Uncle Sam just forgot
it existed after a while.
So, for the last 10 years
or so,
it's been in the hands
of collectors like you.
It may not be that helpful
in a battle no more,
but, damn, if it don't bring
a certain je ne sais quoi
to any military collection
like yours, Sam.
- [door unlocks]
- [cats meowing]
Angus, Socks, Clarabelle,
Morty, Simon, Lizzy,
meet our new friend.
[chuckling] They call him
GI Robot.
[whirring]
GI Robot, at attention, sir!
- [laughing]
- And your name and rank, sir?
I'm I'm, uh, Sam.
Sam Fitzgibbon.
I'm just a guy. No rank.
I wanted to join up,
you know, I really did.
But this damn leg.
Pleased to meet you, friend.
[laughing]
Oh! [laughing]
And, yeah [laughing]
When does it stop?
[chuckling]
Here it is, GI,
my pride and joy.
Go forward!
[gun fires]
It's nice to have a family,
ain't it?
[guns firing on TV]
But I do not get cold, sir.
Well, you never know, son.
It's been hell
trying to get that rust
outta your joints, you know.
Might as well
take some precautions
so your metal don't get
messed up no more.
I think it looks good on you.
[chuckling]
Where are we going, sir?
Ah, nowhere special.
Just meeting up with some boys,
who are all interested
in a better country,
- just like me and you.
- Oh!
You a good friend, boy.
Cheers for the Tin Man?
Absolutely.
Cheers for the Tin Man!
Hell yeah!
Well, what do we
have here, Sam?
It's like what I said, Billy.
This is GI Robot.
I thought he might be
some help for the cause.
Well, glad to have you, GI.
Glad to have a metal fist
in the fight for what's right.
Yes, sir.
[man laughing]
Oh?
- Hmm.

of the Hub City
National Socialists Club.
