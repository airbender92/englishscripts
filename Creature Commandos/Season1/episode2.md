[shuddering]

I don't feel good about this, my son.

Shall each man find a wife for his bosom and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?

- No, but

- I yearn for a wife, Father.

What is it to be human if not for love?

I created you in the interest of exploring that infinitesimal space that falls between life and death.

I have not yet learned enough from you to justify doing it again.

You have a wife.

How is it fair that you know love and I do not?

I am merely saying, if we give it time

Some would suggest that if you do not make me a wife, the only fair remedy would be for me to destroy yours, Father.

"That would bring balance to life," they would say.

No one would say that.

I would say that!

I would!

Am I not someone?

Settle yourself, Eric.

We're already proceeding.

I'm only sharing with you my doubts.

This is what humans do.

Share feelings without becoming over-animated.

This is what the mortician was able to acquire.

- [thunderclap]
- [gasping]
- Oh.
- [gasps]

Oh, my. So beautiful.

This is the face of my true love.

[thunderclap]
You were born here?
Yeah.

And why are we here now?
[thunderclap]
[theme music playing]

What does that do? If I press this button, it activates an unbearably painful jolt directly into their brains.

Oh, is cruel, no?

Is the point, yes.

You need to get your shirt off.

Your wounds need cleaning.

[Rick grunts]
[sighs]

So, with the remote, you control them?

Hypothetically.

They haven't proven themselves to be extraordinarily obedient.

And the skeleton man, Dr. Phosphorus?

[Rick] Yeah.

He tried to kill you to get it?

- Yeah.
- Bozhe moi.

Quite a team, hmm?

I promise, Ilana, I'll get these folks under control and I'll keep you safe.

Don't worry.

You're such a kind man.

That is so rare here in Pokolistan.

I suppose tonight was not your first battle.

[thunder rumbling]
[thunderclap]

[Nina] Are those your parents?
- Tsk.

- Don't tsk me.

That's not cool.

You can say "no."

How would I know who they are?

[Nina] This was his home for work.
Not the family's.


They lived up the road.
[sighs]
Whoa.

My father was a scientist, but he never had anything like this.

Victor was, if nothing else, a renegade.
[thunderclap]
Here.
- I was born here.

- [electricity crackling]

[screaming continues]
- [crackling stops]
- [panting]
[breathing heavily]
[retching]
- My love.
- Wait.


I picked her these flowers.

She must gather her senses.

When a baby is born, she's known her mother's womb, and, therefore, her mother, intimately, for nine months. The womb is one's tether to the universe, to the fragile social system of humanity.

But your bride, she came from nothing to something in an instant.

[gasping]

She has no tether, doesn't know where she is or who we are.

She is but a cluster of fear and not knowing.
- [thuds]
- [Bride crying]

Stop stirring, dear.

- Please.
- [groaning]

Everything is fine.

- These are for you.
- [thunderclap]
- [screaming]
- But What? But
- [screaming]
- But, but

But I But I picked these for you.

[screaming echoes]

That sounds horrible.

Well, birth is always horrible.

God's gift to humans is he lets you forget it. Science isn't so forgiving.

I am not human.

Oh, stop with the bluff, fish.

You're the only one of us freaks who is.

We're monsters. You're a human being with gills.

The world does not see it this way.

[sighs] Well, when has the world ever been right?
- Hmm.
- [creaking]

What are you looking for? Soon, the general is going to notice we're missing and we'll have to feel that awful shock again.

Well, I've felt worse. I do not believe you.

Maybe 'cause I'm lying.

- [objects clattering]

- What are you looking for?

A tourmaline necklace.

It should be here somewhere.

What's tourmaline?

A gemstone. Pinkish.
[thunderclap]

Ap-ple.

Good.
- Cap.
- Close. Hat.
- Hat.
- Good.

You're doing fabulously,

my dear.

Why is this drudgery

so important?

You want a bride who can speak, don't you?

[grunts] Words

get in the way of truth, drowning out the caterwaul of one's heart.

- [clinking]
- [Frankenstein sighs]
This.
What is this?
Pret-ty.
Yes, it is pretty,

but what is it called?

Necklace.
[Bride] Neck-lace.
[thunderclap]

And if we find it, then we can go back?

Yes, if we find it, we can go back.

Because your bitching and moaning is worse than being enslaved by that gung-ho jarhead.

[radio static]
Yeah,

there's two of them inside.

I guess the rest are still back at the castle.

- [radio beeps]
- Okay, cool. Out.
- Tanner says
- [Circe] I heard.
[warbling]

Just get the address.
[all] Oh.
[sighs, burps]
[warbling]
[Rick sighs]
- There.
- Thank you, Ilana.
Um

Where is this one from?

Ilana, we

We can't go through this again.

Where?

I was stabbed in the Persian Gulf.

What about this one?

Ilana, I already told you, it's just not ethical for us to What about

- Don't.

- Do not treat me like a child, Richard.

Don't you know I'm soon to be the queen of this country, and I get what I want?

Oh, boy.

A boy?

I don't know how he could hold out for more than 30 seconds, do you?

Ah, you got a point, Weez.

He's an older guy, probably has a lot of experience.

Give him a full minute.
