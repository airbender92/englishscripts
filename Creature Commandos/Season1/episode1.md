We need to help Rostovic. I thought Congress put a stop to all Task Force X activities since your daughter outed you.

[Waller] Technically, Congress said A.R.G.U.S. can't use incarcerated human beings as mission operatives
any longer.

But what about beings that aren't human?

[door unlocks]

Huh? What in the holy hell?

[Waller] This is the Belle Reve Non-Human Internment Division.

These assholes aren't human.

She's not human?

- Minimal?
- Consider it a free vasectomy.

[choking]

[Flag] What is that thing?

[Waller] The Weasel.

It's one of the few soldiers still alive from Project Starfish in Corto Maltese. 

So we know it has what it takes to survive.

Sorry.

I didn't mean to intimate anything about your son, Flag.

When he died in Corto Maltese, he died a hero.

That one looks like a discontinued dishwasher.

[Waller] That dishwasher killed over 300 Nazis in World War II.

I would have dismantled it, but I thought it might come in use someday.

It's known as G.I. Robot.

Last one is Nina Mazursky.

What use is she walking around in a fishbowl?

Get her in water it's a different story.

She's the smartest and most reasonable of the bunch.

She might be able to help you keep the rest of them in line.

This is your new task force, Flag.

[theme music playing]

There's an Osprey waiting to take you directly to the castle to protect Princess Rostovic
from Circe and her forces.

[door opens and closes]

I know you all aren't exactly enthusiastic about this mission.
- But
- [groans]

General, I believe you've read us wrong.

We're delighted to be here and delighted to serve our country.

Okay. Uh, great.

- Are you smiling?
- Yes.
- Sarcastically?
- Mmm-hmm.

[chitters]

G.I. Robot is detecting unease.

Could he be, G.I. Robot asks, in fear of being discovered as Nazi scum?

No. Put your arm Your gun down.

He's not a Nazi. Child killer, though.

Not a great look. Supposedly, he had a bad experience the last trip he took on this Osprey, that's all.

Are we in goddamn Pokolistan?

You've been here before?

[groans] Fucking hell.

- I am sorry.

We must only do sacred, customary bow in this castle.

We are so much like Americans, yes?

Ooh, we pull pranks like Jamie Kennedy Experiment.

We do the Super Bowl shovel!

We like to say "Wazzup?"

Well, you're certainly current with your popular cultural references.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Sarcastic smile.

Now, I have question for you, Skeleton.

Where's the beef?

[laughs]

Clara Peller, one of the greats Enough, Alexi.

We've prepared a banquet for you, our honored guests.

[Weasel chomping]

They've been living on prison grub for quite some time.

Forgive their manners, Your Highness. Just Ilana's fine.

We don't stand on ceremony here.

Oh, okay. Then Sure.

You've sampled this prison grub?

[chuckles] Just seeing it is enough to give me the collywobbles,

Your High Ilana.

[laughs] Their manners do not bother me.

I love seeing friends enjoying themselves.

[woman groaning]

[Ilana] That is the Queen.

Poor, sweet mother.

She has not been self for some long time now.
- [groans]
- Yes, Mother. Of course.

She says she's pleased you're here.

Oh.

You see why I'm taking care of Pokolistan's affairs?

Even though it won't quite be official until You know.

[Queen groans]

You're welcome, Mother. I love you, too.

- G.I. Robot?

- Yes, Miss Nina.

Would you like anything? Diesel?

Some diesel fuel, please, for our robot friend.

Yes, madam.

Right away, madam.

[Ilana chuckles]

Mmm. It is a beautiful evening, isn't it?

I do not enjoy landscapes devoid of dead Nazis,

- Miss Nina.

- Oh.

Can Miss Nina and G.I. Robot be killing Nazis soon?

Miss Waller promised it would be soon.

It's been oh so long since G.I. Robot has sent Nazis back to hell where they belong.

I think you will be, soon.

G.I. Robot would like to kill Nazis with you.

Would you like to kill Nazis with G.I. Robot?

If I killed Nazis with anyone, it would certainly be you, G.I. Robot.

Oh, my.

G.I. Robot has been waiting for a friend to kill Nazis with for 74 years, 23 days and 52 minutes.

I hope we aren't too much of an intrusion.

Our only goal here is to keep you safe, Ilana.

I'm happy to have the company.

Even that one?

[laughs]

Why was he in prison?

Uh, supposedly murdered

- twenty-seven children.
- Oh.

He hasn't shown any violent tendencies since then,

so I wouldn't fret.

I also wouldn't invite the school choir to the castle while he's here.

[laughs]

Oh, no, I like American music.

Rock and roll!

[both laughing]

But, yes, I am happy for the company, especially the company of Americans.

My country is a charming one, but it is backwards, always rejecting progress as corrupt.

It is my most cherished dream to lead my people into the 21st century.

Well, I've been there.

I'm not sure I'd recommend it.

Are you married, Richard Flag?

No. No.

I was once, but my wife ended up being my least favorite aspect of that 21st century you're all gung ho about.

I will avoid that part of the 21st century then.

[chuckles]

Well, sometimes, missteps lead you where you need to be.

She and I had a son when we were just 18.

Fine young man.

I joined the military mostly just to make money so I could support him.

Eighteen years later, he joined the military because he loved our country and he wanted to make it a better place.

Yeah. Boy was an improvement on me in every way. Was?

He passed on about two years back.

Oh. I'm sorry.

I would have liked to introduce the two of you. [chuckles]

I have a feeling you would have gotten on like a house on fire.

[chuckles] A house on fire does not seem good.

No, it's It's supposed to be a good thing.

I'm sure your son was a fine man,

but I'm much more fond of older men.

I'd like to show you something.

This armoire is beautiful, no?

Um, sure.

It is over 500 years old.

What is it you wanted to show me, Ilana?

[chuckles]

Just this wonderful armoire.

That's not an armoire.

- Listen, Ilana

- Yes?

I just I don't think this is exactly ethical.

I'm here to protect you.

[Ilana] To protect me from loneliness?

No, I From lack of passion?

No, I From Pokolistani men

who have never seen the world, have no clue how to treat a woman, and who can't see me as a human being I am behind the veil of royalty?

Closer, but still no.

Look, I think we need to get some shut-eye so we can put a cogent plan in place in the morning.

[sighs]

I'll leave G.I. Robot to guard the door. Richard.

We're here to protect them.

- Why would they stop me?
- [grumbles]

Hey, you can't leave.

[Bride] Why not?

Well, Flag will use the remote to shock you, and then we all get shocked.

Seems like a flaw in the system to me to get shocked even when I didn't do anything wrong.

That was the worst feeling ever.

Grow a pair, Fish.

A pair of what?

Wait, where are you going?

- [Bride] Open the door.
- [Nina] Oh, my God.

[guard] I do not have you in the schedule.

He doesn't have us in the schedule.

Oh, darn it!

- Do you have any money?
- [Nina whimpers]
- Pardon?
- [Bride] Money.

Cough up some cash. I don't have any freaking rubles on me.

How am I supposed to get around?

Our money is not called ruble.

Yeah, I know.

It was meant to be insulting.

Just give me some cash.

Thank you.

She means to say thank you.

[Bride] No, I don't mean anything of the sort!

[Nina] You asked him for money, and he just gave it to you.
