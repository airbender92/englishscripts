##  Creature Commandos 

[original resource](https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=creature-commandos-2024&episode=s01e01)


*[reporter]*  The battalion, calling themselves the Sons of Themyscira, violently crossed the border into Pokolistan.

The Sons are said to be working at the behest of the rogue Amazonian and reputed sorceress, Circe.

Circe claims to be the rightful heir to the throne of the perhaps mythical, perhaps real, all-female island nation of Themyscira.

Inside sources claim Circe has promised the Sons that once the downfall of Pokolistan is achieved, she will lead them to conquer Themyscira.

I mean, seriously, Themyscira is the sickest place ever. And then you tell me, "Oh, dude, only women can live there"?

[chuckles] What? They're so sexist, bro. Word is they have the most incredible waterfalls.

I have this question for all the woke feminists out there,
 
why do only girls get such cool waterfalls?

All over the world, our rights as men are being denigrated.

- [switches off TV]
- What a bunch of clowns.

Dangerous clowns. Pokolistan is a friend of the US.

Countries don't have friends After your decades in the military, General Flag,

I think you'd understand that true friendship is built on petroleum deposits.

Especially unmined ones in a backward-ass country that's never taken advantage of their natural resources.

Princess Ilana Rostovic, the heir apparent to Pokolistan,

is already negotiating with the US for that oil.

And if she's overthrown by some nutjob in a witch's hat, all bets are off.

We need to help Rostovic. I thought Congress put a stop to all Task Force X activities since your daughter outed you.

[Waller] Technically, Congress said A.R.G.U.S. can't use incarcerated human beings as mission operatives
any longer.

But what about beings that aren't human?

[door unlocks]

Huh? What in the holy hell?

[Waller] This is the Belle Reve Non-Human Internment Division.

For over 50 years, only those at the uppermost levels of security clearance are aware of its existence.

By using these prisoners, I think we can arguably circumvent our new restrictions.

Arguably? How?

Congress said we can't use human prisoners.

These assholes aren't human.

She's not human?

[Waller] Is a corpse human?

[sighs]
- Who is she?
- We don't know. We call her The Bride. Who's Jason and the Argonauts?

[Waller] A sociopath who calls himself Dr. Phosphorus.

He has irradiated skin he can use to burn through people and objects.

Well, how does that radiation affect the people around him?

If you don't sleep in the same room with him, the effects should be minimal.

- Minimal?
- Consider it a free vasectomy.

[choking]

[Flag] What is that thing?

[Waller] The Weasel.

It's one of the few soldiers still alive from Project Starfish in Corto Maltese. 

So we know it has what it takes to survive.

Sorry.

I didn't mean to intimate anything about your son, Flag.

When he died in Corto Maltese, he died a hero.

That one looks like a discontinued dishwasher.

[Waller] That dishwasher killed over 300 Nazis in World War II.

I would have dismantled it, but I thought it might come in use someday.

It's known as G.I. Robot.

Last one is Nina Mazursky.

What use is she walking around in a fishbowl?

Get her in water it's a different story.

She's the smartest and most reasonable of the bunch.

She might be able to help you keep the rest of them in line.

[alarm blaring]

- [screams]

- [snarls]

[growls]

[all groaning]

[all thud]

This is your new task force, Flag.

Let's call it Task Force M. M for monster. Also known as

[theme music playing]

There's an Osprey waiting to take you directly to the castle to protect Princess Rostovic
from Circe and her forces.

[door opens and closes]

I know you all aren't exactly enthusiastic about this mission.
- But
- [groans]

General, I believe you've read us wrong.

We're delighted to be here and delighted to serve our country.

Okay. Uh, great.

- Are you smiling?
- Yes.
- Sarcastically?
- Mmm-hmm.

[chitters]

G.I. Robot is detecting unease.

Could he be, G.I. Robot asks, in fear of being discovered as Nazi scum?

No. Put your arm Your gun down.

He's not a Nazi. Child killer, though.

Not a great look. Supposedly, he had a bad experience the last trip he took on this Osprey, that's all.

Are we in goddamn Pokolistan?

You've been here before?

[groans] Fucking hell.

[Ilana] Richard Bill Flag, Sr.

So wonderful to be meeting you.

Yes, you too.

- Your middle name is Bill?
- Yes.
- Not, like, William?
- No.
- Whose middle name is Bill?
- Mine! Okay?

Princess Rostovic,

it's an honor.

This is not the kind of bow we do in Pokolistan, Mr. Richard Flag.

So, unfortunately,

- we have to kill you.
- What?
- Alexi.
- I am sorry.

We must only do sacred, customary bow in this castle.

Everyone, murder this man.

What? Hold on a minute.

No one briefed me on what kind of bow

[laughs]

[all laughing]

Alexi. [chuckles]

They're How do you say it? Messing on you?

I am making joke! [laughs]

For a minute, I think you're going to make mess in your pants, huh?

[laughs]

I was never gonna Very close to messing his plans.

I wasn't even in the vicinity of doing that.

We are so much like Americans, yes?

Ooh, we pull pranks like Jamie Kennedy Experiment.

We do the Super Bowl shovel!

We like to say "Wazzup?"

Well, you're certainly current with your popular cultural references.

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Sarcastic smile.

Now, I have question for you, Skeleton.

Where's the beef?

[laughs]

Clara Peller, one of the greats Enough, Alexi.

We've prepared a banquet for you, our honored guests.

[Weasel chitters softly]

[Weasel chomping]

They've been living on prison grub for quite some time.

Forgive their manners, Your Highness. Just Ilana's fine.

We don't stand on ceremony here.

Oh, okay. Then Sure.

You've sampled this prison grub?

[chuckles] Just seeing it is enough to give me the collywobbles,

Your High Ilana.

[laughs] Their manners do not bother me.

I love seeing friends enjoying themselves.

[woman groaning]

[Ilana] That is the Queen.

Poor, sweet mother.

She has not been self for some long time now.
- [groans]
- Yes, Mother. Of course.

She says she's pleased you're here.

Oh.

You see why I'm taking care of Pokolistan's affairs?

Even though it won't quite be official until You know.

[Queen groans]

You're welcome, Mother. I love you, too.

- G.I. Robot?

- Yes, Miss Nina.

Would you like anything? Diesel?

Some diesel fuel, please, for our robot friend.

Yes, madam.

Right away, madam.

[Ilana chuckles]

Mmm. It is a beautiful evening, isn't it?

I do not enjoy landscapes devoid of dead Nazis,

- Miss Nina.

- Oh.

Can Miss Nina and G.I. Robot be killing Nazis soon?

Miss Waller promised it would be soon.

It's been oh so long since G.I. Robot has sent Nazis back to hell where they belong.

I think you will be, soon.

G.I. Robot would like to kill Nazis with you.

Would you like to kill Nazis with G.I. Robot?

If I killed Nazis with anyone, it would certainly be you, G.I. Robot.

Oh, my.

G.I. Robot has been waiting for a friend to kill Nazis with for 74 years, 23 days and 52 minutes.

I hope we aren't too much of an intrusion.

Our only goal here is to keep you safe, Ilana.

I'm happy to have the company.

Even that one?

[laughs]

Why was he in prison?

Uh, supposedly murdered

- twenty-seven children.
- Oh.

He hasn't shown any violent tendencies since then,

so I wouldn't fret.

I also wouldn't invite the school choir to the castle while he's here.

[laughs]

Oh, no, I like American music.

Rock and roll!

[both laughing]

But, yes, I am happy for the company, especially the company of Americans.

My country is a charming one, but it is backwards, always rejecting progress as corrupt.

It is my most cherished dream to lead my people into the 21st century.

Well, I've been there.

I'm not sure I'd recommend it.

Are you married, Richard Flag?

No. No.

I was once, but my wife ended up being my least favorite aspect of that 21st century you're all gung ho about.

I will avoid that part of the 21st century then.

[chuckles]

Well, sometimes, missteps lead you where you need to be.

She and I had a son when we were just 18.

Fine young man.

I joined the military mostly just to make money so I could support him.

Eighteen years later, he joined the military because he loved our country and he wanted to make it a better place.

Yeah. Boy was an improvement on me in every way. Was?

He passed on about two years back.

Oh. I'm sorry.

I would have liked to introduce the two of you. [chuckles]

I have a feeling you would have gotten on like a house on fire.

[chuckles] A house on fire does not seem good.

No, it's It's supposed to be a good thing.

I'm sure your son was a fine man,

but I'm much more fond of older men.

I'd like to show you something.

This armoire is beautiful, no?

Um, sure.

It is over 500 years old.

What is it you wanted to show me, Ilana?

[chuckles]

Just this wonderful armoire.

That's not an armoire.

- Listen, Ilana

- Yes?

I just I don't think this is exactly ethical.

I'm here to protect you.

[Ilana] To protect me from loneliness?

No, I From lack of passion?

No, I From Pokolistani men

who have never seen the world, have no clue how to treat a woman, and who can't see me as a human being I am behind the veil of royalty?

Closer, but still no.

Look, I think we need to get some shut-eye so we can put a cogent plan in place in the morning.

[sighs]

I'll leave G.I. Robot to guard the door. Richard.

- [G.I. Robot] In June 1944
- [snoring]

38 dead Nazis.

In September of 1944, I fought at the Battle of Huertgen Forest.

A whopping 92 dead Nazis. In October of 1944, at the Battle of Aachen,

I ended the lives of 14 Nazis

[window creaks]

Bride?
- Bride.
- How did you get down here?

I walked down the stairs.

No one tried to stop you?

We're here to protect them.

- Why would they stop me?
- [grumbles]

Hey, you can't leave.

[Bride] Why not?

Well, Flag will use the remote to shock you, and then we all get shocked.

Seems like a flaw in the system to me to get shocked even when I didn't do anything wrong.

That was the worst feeling ever.

Grow a pair, Fish.

A pair of what?

Wait, where are you going?

- [Bride] Open the door.
- [Nina] Oh, my God.

[guard] I do not have you in the schedule.

He doesn't have us in the schedule.

I don't need a schedule, Sir, Douche A Lot.

I'm not your prisoner, so open the freaking door.

[hesitates]

[Nina] Bride, please, come on, stay.

Oh, darn it!

- Do you have any money?
- [Nina whimpers]
- Pardon?
- [Bride] Money.

Cough up some cash. I don't have any freaking rubles on me.

How am I supposed to get around?

Our money is not called ruble.

Yeah, I know.

It was meant to be insulting.

Just give me some cash.

Hey!

Thank you.

She means to say thank you.

[Bride] No, I don't mean anything of the sort!

[Nina] You asked him for money, and he just gave it to you.

- That's right.
- [Nina] It was rude.

Yeah, that's right.

[Nina] We shouldn't leave. Look, no one is forcing you to come.

[Dr. Phosphorous laughs wickedly]

[groans]

- No, please, no!
- Richard?

Phosphorus, you idiot!

You think Waller would give me the only remote?

You'd be hopping around like a Mexican jumping bean for days, if you escaped.

Or, If I told her about this I'm not here to torture you.

We're supposed to be on the same damn team.

[Nina] Thank you.

[Nina gasps]

What is this place?

Where I was born.
