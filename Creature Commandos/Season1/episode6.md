Alex. Alex. Alex.
You ain't going nowhere.
Won't you get that through your skull?

[Nina gasping]
[breathing shakily]
Okay. [exhales shakily]
Ah!
[whispering] Jesus, Nina!
What the hell!
Don't sneak up on me like that.
[whispering] They're trying to kill us.
What option do I have but to sneak?
- Oh, shit!
- Oh!
[footsteps approaching]
Damn it!
[knight in Pokolistani]
[both panting]
[in English] Did they see?
I don't know. I
- [soft music playing]
- [The Bride] Huh?
[women giggling]
Mon Dieu!
You! You look like the boss.
Tell them to pretend
like we're not here,
or I will blow your head off!
[Nina] Okay, maybe
don't blow her head off.
Yes, blow her head off!
Oh, my God, you're crazy!
You're always
so hyperbolically violent.
- You need therapy.
- [loud knocking on door]
[knight in Pokolistani]
[latch clicks open]
Bonjour.
[in English] May I help you?
[knight in Pokolistani]
- [soft music playing]
- [women whispering]
[women giggling]
[in English] Oh? Maybe you saw
Radka and Silviya
returning from the store?
[women giggling, laughing]
[knight in Pokolistani]
[exclaims]
[grunting]
[in English] Please return when
you are not working.
Our girls would all like to get to know
a handsome, royal knight
more intimately.
[sighs]
Fine.
We helped you, yes?
So seems like good time
for you to be leaving.
I think we'll hang here
till the heat is off.
You know what?
Um, maybe we can make it, like, fun?
You know, do something
to pass the time.
- [The Bride sighs]
- Do you guys
have Scattergories?
[intense music playing]
Oh, shit.
Doctor, my name is Amanda Waller.
I'm the director of A.R.G.U.S.
This man, General Rick Flag,
reports to me. What happened?
I don't know.
He's in a coma. His back is broken,
and he seems to have suffered
major internal damage.
Supposedly, some type of, uh, monster.
- [Economos] Monster?
- Dropped him off
at the Emergency Room doors.
What kind of monster?
Reptaloid? Amphibious? Simian?
Mite? Poltergeist?
He was green, about seven feet tall.
Humanoid.
- Is that a thing?
- That's a thing.
He had bolts on his head.
Eric Frankenstein.
He's been stalking
The Bride for centuries.
I'm sorry. You're gonna
have to wait out here.
Is he gonna be okay?
Maybe. But not if we
don't tend to him now.
If Flag told Frankenstein
where The Bride is
He could stop her from
assassinating the Princess,
which, according to Circe,
is how World War Three starts.
Get operatives watching
the local airports immediately.
[whirring]
- [man screaming]
- [gasps]
Slight change in the manifest, pilot.
I'll be joining my two friends
traveling to Pokolistan tonight.
Do you believe in love, my friend?
I do, I really do.
And the woman I love is about
to make a tragic mistake,
and I need to warn her.
She's been bamboozled
by malevolent forces.
And she's about to kill
someone she shouldn't kill.
Yikes, right?
But here's the twist.
Once I save her
from making this tragic error,
I'm pretty sure
she won't be able to deny
how she and I are meant to be together.
So, why don't you do
what you were born to do,
to play your small role
in this romantic adventure
and turn the fuck around and fly!
[machine whirring]
- Everything good?
- Uh, all good. [clears throat]

- [Alex laughing]
- [Dr. Phosphorus sighs]
[grunts soflty]
[Parvin] Alex, I don't like it.
These people are
I don't like them either,
Parvin, but
There is no good end to this.
There is a good end to it, babe.
That's why I'm doing this.
I can't continue my research
without their funding.
I love you. You know that?
[Parvin] That is irrelevant
to what we are talking about
They're not good people!
But a nuclear fusion treatment
that destroys cancer forever
without harming the patient?
That's worth dealing with anyone!
With a treatment like that,
my father might still be alive.
- Your mother.
- Maybe
there is some other way.
[Alex screaming]
[crying]
Sorry, Sartorius,
but this is the way it has to be.
- [Alex wailing]
- [thugs laughing]
Yeah. [laughs]
[Rupert] Yeah, that's right.
Get his prints in there good.

[exclaiming in delight]
[playful barks, shrieks]
Have you ever
considered this line of work?
A couple of girls like you
would be popular.
Men are always looking for
[clicks tongue]
How they say
a bit of strange.
Nina and I have a little more respect
for ourselves than that.
You use your body as weapon
to kill people.
As opposed to source of pleasure.
This is how you respect yourself?
[blows raspberry]
[Madam] Your eyes tell story.
You have no respect for yourself,
- nor for anyone else.
- [scoffs]
These girls here
They struggle
because they want to live.
You do everything you can to die.
[The Bride grunts angrily]
- [Nina] Bride, don't!
- [glass breaking]
I must agree with your friend.
She's not my friend.
[loud knocking on door]
Will bring much suspicion
if we do not answer that door.
Your choice.
[The Bride grunts in frustration]
[chuckling] Bonjour.
- Oh, look at this
- [woman exclaims]
- fine piece of ass, Brian.
- [woman laughs forcibly]
[Craic brothers laughing]
Yeah.
The Craic Brothers in
the house! Let's party, yeah?
- [Craic brother 1 grunts]
- [The Bride snorts]
What a wonderful life
worth struggling for.
[playful squealing]
[spoon clanging softly]
[chomping]
[Dr. Phosphorus] I really wish
you wouldn't have come out here.
I don't want to risk you
telling anyone I was here.
[wailing]
[Rupert] So, this is where
the magic happens, huh?
[Alex sobbing]
Why
Why are you doing this?
You knew the deal, Alex.
We'd fund your experiments
on nuclear fusion
so you could make cancer go bye-bye.
But we would get the results
of all of those experiments
to share with our friends overseas.
Yes, Bialya.
A fascist regime.
I try not to be so judgmental.
It's business.
Well, I did what you wanted!
I gave you all the results!
[shouts] You gave me
- [groaning]
- bullshit!
You think these Bialyan scientists
can't see through your
made-up stats and research?
Now it is my ass
on the line, you crumb
[thug] Mr. Thorne
Oh, no, no
This looks like
it might be the real thing.
There's all sorts of numbers here.
My wife
She came from a country
with an oppressive regime.
She is
was sensitive about giving
nuclear secrets to another
Oh, what a prince.
Right, guys?
Throwing his dead wife under the bus.
No, no I just
I didn't think anyone would notice.
The con man's excuse is
[in a mocking tone]
"I didn't think no one
would know I was conning them."
[in normal voice]
Pack all the files up,
grab the hard drives.
What about him?
[intense music playing]
[Alex screaming] No, no, no! Ahh!
No [groaning]
[screaming] No.
[muffled yelling]
[thugs grunting]
[yelling] No, no, ugh!
It's the age-old story
of the nuclear scientist
who goes crazy, murders his family
and then commits suicide
- by atomizing himself
- [screaming]
with nuclear energy.
- [screaming]
- [little girl] Skelet.
Skelet.
Yeah. Skeleton. That's me.
Priyatel skelet!
Not sure what that means.
[loud whirring starts]
[hissing]
[Alex screaming]
[howling]
[screaming continues]
[all laughing]
- [thug 1] Oh, yeah!
- [thug 2] Yeah!
[screaming]
[explosion]
[thugs laughing and cheering]
Don't mess with Rupert Thorne.
[thug 1 laughing] Look at him.
[thug 2] Say hi to your wife.
[little girl laughing]
[chuckles]
It looks like I'm smiling too.
But I'm not.
[dramatic music plays]
[woman screaming]
[Madam panting]
[sighs] What now?
[panting]
[whimpering]
[seething] Get out this minute!
Bitch hit me!
- [seething]
- I told him he was hurting me.
Get out!
No one touches the girls in a way
they don't want to be touched.
I do what I want, eh, fat toe?
Ah
- Metahuman.
- [Craic brother 1 exhales]
Well, let me state plainly
the rules of Madam Gyurov's.
No one is allowed to hurt our girls.
And Metahumans are welcome,
but they cannot use
their powers on premises
- [Craic brother 1 grunts]
- [gasping]
[grunts]
[groans]
- [grunts]
- [yelps]
You're the can of piss what
caused all this now, aintcha?
Lucky for you
that's just the kind of thing
that gets me going.
[exclaims, seethes]
Get away from her and get out,
like she said.
What kind of freak are you?
- [Nina grunts]
- [yelps]
What's happening?
Everywhere I go, a whore
is trying to ruin my fun.
Let's kill all of them,
and get the hell out of here.
Ah, jeez, Paddy, again?
- All right!
- [gunshot]
- [folk music playing]
- Ah!
You crashed the wrong whorehouse.
[screams] Brian!
[roaring]
[The Bride groaning]
[grunts, screams]
[Paddy seething]
[panting]
[Paddy] Come on.
Come on! [grunts]

[Paddy grunting]

[straining]
- [groans]
- [flesh squelches]
[Paddy gargling]
- [heart thumping]
- [gasping]
Probably not how you expected
your day to end.
[strained breathing]
[grunts]
This kind of thing is a common
occurrence with her?
Sort of [hesitates] yes. Sadly.
[door creaks]
Merci.
[grunts]
- Softie.
- [exhales]
Well, it's 'cause I was
saving you again, idiot.
Because you are my friend?
[The Bride] Get over yourself, fish.
