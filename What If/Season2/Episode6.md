THE WATCHER: Asgard's nightmare
is the same in many realities.
The flames of Ragnarok.
In your universe, Odin
entrusted the Tesseract
to a village on Earth after
achieving an age of peace.
But in this universe, fire came for
Asgard before he had the chance.
I am Asgard's doom.
No!
THE WATCHER: The destruction
of Asgard would lead to
new wonders from a
single ember of the past.
The Tesseract survived Ragnarok
and would find a new home
in a new world.
Time.
Space.
Reality.
It's more than a linear path.
It's a prism of endless possibility,
where a single choice can
branch out into infinite realities,
creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.
I am the Watcher.
I am your guide through
these vast new realities.
Follow me and ponder the question
"What if?"
(SPEAKING MOHAWK) Come on, let's go!
(GASPS)
(CHUCKLES)
Wáhta, hurry up!
Kahhori
Kahhori, would you slow down.
I'm almost
(KAHHORI SPEAKING) I'm waiting.
(WÁHTA SPEAKING) Thanks. I just
(KAHHORI SPEAKING) Keep up!
(WÁHTA GROANS AND SPEAKS) Come on!
Kahhori!
(KAHHORI EXCLAIMS AND CHUCKLES)
(WÁHTA SPEAKING)
I need air.
And water.
And preferably a lot of them.
(GASPS) Uh
I wouldn't drink anything around here.
(GASPS)
Kahhori.
We're not supposed to go
near the old battlefield.
The elders said so!
This place is cursed.
It's cursed because no one cleansed it
after all the bloodshed.
Calm down and listen.
You can hear them.
(WÁHTA SPEAKING) Them?
The lake contains a great power.
Power enough to take us to the Sky World.
These people fought
for control of the lake
when it should have
brought them together.
Together?
The lake ate people!
Big, strong, muscle-y people
went into the lake and then
- (MIMICS GULPING)
- (SHUSHES)
(GASPS)
The Forbidden Lake
is a puddle.
No, this can't be it.
What's so forbidden about this?
There's ducks.
Mmm.
- (GUNSHOT IN DISTANCE)
- (GASPS)
WÁHTA: Huh?
Thunder?
(GASPS)
The village
Monsters.
(HORSE SNORTS)
Go!
(SPEAKING SPANISH) Hey! Get back here!
After them!
Come on, quickly!
Hey! They went this way!
Spread out!
Follow them!
Over here! Come on!
Up the hill!
Don't let them get away!
- (KAHHORI SPEAKING) Wáhta!
- (WÁHTA YELLS)
(MAN 2 SPEAKING) Look! Over here!
(MAN 2 SPEAKING) What is this?
(SPEAKING MOHAWK) Come on.
(GASPS)
(WÁHTA SPEAKING) You were right.
It's all real.
(KAHHORI SPEAKING)
The elders were wrong
that lake was
A decoy lake.
With decoy ducks.
(MAN 1 SPEAKING SPANISH) Hey! Listen!
- (SPEAKING MOHAWK) What do we do?
- Go. Hide.
(MAN 1 SPEAKING SPANISH)
They can't have gone far.
Any sign of them?
I think I found what we're looking for.
- (PANTING)
- (GRAVELS CLATTERING)
Hey! Come out!
KAHHORI: Hey!
(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTS)
- (YELPS)
- Kahhori!
(MAN 3 SPEAKING SPANISH) Did you get her?
Yes.
- (MAN LAUGHING)
- (GASPS)
(GRUNTS)
(GASPS)
(WINCES)
(SPEAKING MOHAWK) Easy
Easy, sister.
(MAN CHUCKLES)
Welcome to Sky World.
the Tesseract took on a second life
among Kahhori's ancestors.
Breaking on impact,
the Cube released unmitigated
Space Stone energy,
gifting its power to the lake.
Warriors, adventurers
and other noble tribespeople
disappeared into the waters,
never to return.
Greed and grief
ignited a terrible battle
amongst the surrounding nations.
In the end, peace was made,
and the lake's blood-soaked shores
were deemed cursed,
deterring all from returning to it.
Well, all but one.
Wáhta?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(GROANS)
Wáhta?
- (WHOOSHING)
- (GASPS)
(SPEAKING MOHAWK) How is this possible?
That blue light you fell through?
Its spirit seeps into everything
the water, land, plants.
When we eat their spirits,
we take in some of its power too.
Just being here will change you.
How ? What ?
Who are you?
Okay, let's do this backwards.
"Who?" I am Atahraks.
I'm Kahhori.
Pleasure to meet you.
"What" is pretty amazing.
And "How?"
You fell through the portal in the lake.
The Forbidden Lake.
It's forbidden now?
Yeah, that's probably a smart move.
Lotta people went missing
in that lake when I was a kid
including my cousin.
But look, he's here.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hello!
Thank you, Mister you.
But I have to go home
Home! My village! We were attacked.
Wáhta!
Kahhori, you can't
Kahhori!
Kahhori!
Kahhori?
We fall into this paradise.
We do not age. We do not die.
Because we are meant to be here.
Permanently.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
The name is Conquistador
Rodrigo Alphonso Gonzolo.
And in the name of
Queen Isabella of Spain,
I have come to claim
The Fountain of Youth.
I have heard your legends.
You fear this land.
Fear its power.
The Fountain of Youth.
Your "lake".
Forbidden Lake?
(CHUCKLES)
(GRUNTS)
Where is it?
Where?
Where?
(MAN SPEAKING SPANISH) Commander!
What do you want?
We found it.
(KAHHORI GRUNTING)
(KAHHORI GRUNTING)
The land wants to help you, Kahhori.
Good, then it can take me home.
Look, I know this isn't
where you want to be,
but the waters brought us here
for a reason. Slow down.
Feel the spirit of this place.
See for yourself.
Whoa. Quick learner.
What kind of clay are you made of?
Wolf.
Yeah, that sounds right.
Got some turtle in me myself.
There's so many things
we can do with these powers.
How can you tell me they have a limit?
Plenty have tried to leave.
They all failed.
The portal's just out of reach.
Then they weren't trying hard enough.
Or maybe this place
became their home.
That won't be me.
Good luck
- (SCREAMS)
- (CHUCKLES)
The record's fourteen steps.
But the wind's a little strong today.
(KAHHORI SPEAKING) This isn't paradise.
It's a prison.
(SIGHS) Kahhori.
- (BIRD CAWS)
- Huh?
The hunt!
The hunt?
You'll love it!
(WHOOPING)
Show off.
That's the best prize on this rock.
It takes years for them to sprout,
stuffing the fruit with an insane
amount of the planet's spirit.
We're "hunting" for fruit?
Why don't we just go pick it up?
Well that's no fun
(BLOWS)
Be careful.
They are grumpy when they first wake up.
Huh?
Don't worry no one
gets it their first time.
(GROWLS)
Welcome to the new world.
(CHUCKLES)
Whoa! Ahhh!
Hey, Kahhori!
The trick is to go over them,
never in front of them.
(GASPS)
Come on, Kahhori!
Cut loose! Show us what you got!
(CHUCKLES AND GRUNTS)
(LAUGHS)
(SCREAMS)
How do you stop?
You just stop.
Stop!
Whoa, she's fast!
(SCREAMS)
(PANTING)
(LAUGHS)
(EXCLAIMS)
(GRUNTS)
Alright, everyone.
How'd we do?
Four over here.
Just three.
- Twelve!
- Twelve?
Nice!
Wait, wait Where's Kahhori?
Look!
- (GASPS)
- Phew!
That was fun.
After that, I can eat.
I am hungry.
- (ALL MURMURING)
- (GASPS)
Nice!
WOMAN: Kahhori.
Our names carry the spirit and strength
of those who had them before us.
And yours, Kahhori, is made better
by your victory today.
(ALL CHEERING)
(SPEAKING SPANISH) At long last.
The Fountain of Youth.
My loyal soldiers,
who wants the first
slice of immortality?
(SOLDIERS CLAMORING)
Well?
Feeling any younger?
I hope so.
My knees are still killing me.
(SCREAMS)
What?
Get out now!
Come on! Get out!
- Luis, come on!
- Commander!
- Come on!
- Help me!
- Quickly!
- Commander!
- (SCREAMS)
- No!
(SOLDIER SPEAKING) This place is cursed.
I want them all in chains.
We leave for Spain!
Imagine what treasure is hiding
here behind such magic?
(PEOPLE SINGING IN MOHAWK)
(SPEAKING SPANISH) Fortune awaits. Load!
(LAUGHS) Kahhori.
(SPEAKING MOHAWK)
Is this place still a prison?
(LAUGHS)
Get down!
(YELLING IN SPANISH) For Spain!
(GASPS)
What?
Run, run!
(GRUNTS)
(KAHHORI SPEAKING MOHAWK)
What have you done with my people?
Kahhori.
No! These monsters attacked my village!
Wáhta
What have you done with him?
(SPEAKS SPANISH) Help!
(SPEAKING MOHAWK) Let's just talk
No. You All of you,
you've been away from the bones
of your ancestors for too long.
The waters sent you here.
The spirit in this land made
you strong. Gave you gifts.
But you've gotten too comfortable.
You've forgotten your origins.
But I can't.
(GROANS)
Not when our people are hurting.
ATAHRAKS: Kahhori.
The land.
It wants to help you
Even in a place of such miracles
I will keep my people in front of me.
(KAHHORI GRUNTS)
I want to help all of my people.
Including you.
But you'll be stuck here forever
unless you learn to move.
I'm going to fight.
Who's with me?
Atahraks?
War, Kahhori?
We aren't an army.
We have a different life here,
free from all that.
You do.
But my people don't.
They need us to be brave.
I'm going to face the monsters.
To save anyone I can.
Kahhori, wait
If you're worthy of this place,
you'll join me.
(WHOOSHING)
(MEN SCREAMING)
(SPEAKING SPANISH) A witch
A witch! Shoot her!
(GRUNTING)
(GROWLS)
(SPEAKING SPANISH) Form a line!
Cannons! To the cannons!
(BELL RINGING)
Shoot the witch!
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS)
(CHUCKLES)
- (WIND WHISTLING)
- Huh?
(GROANS)
(GROANS)
- (GASPS)
- (SPEAKING MOHAWK) Easy, sister.
Atahraks?
Everything you said was true.
So we followed.
- (YELLS)
- (GRUNTS)
Wáhta?
Kahhori?
- Wáhta.
- Kahhori?
Wáhta?
Kahhori.
You came back.
And I brought friends.
They are our people, Wáhta.
Now, watch closely.
Witness their deeds.
Remember their faces.
We're going to need some
new songs about today.
Thunder beings.
And your sister is
the bravest one of all.
THE WATCHER: So many
stories spawn from a choice.
But Kahhori's victory wasn't because
she merely chose the right path.
No, it was her conviction, because
she remained true to her course,
unwavering in the face of both
devastation and miracles alike.
Such resolve is often
what burns brightest.
What elevates an individual
to something more.
And perhaps it's why heroes very seldom
stop after their first victory.
(MAN SPEAKING SPANISH) First Gonzolo,
then Jacobo and the Mendoza brothers.
No one has returned.
My queen, I'm afraid we
can no longer deny it.
You have lost the New World.
(CHUCKLES)
Impossible. My soldiers are unmatched.
My fleets unrivaled.
What nation is stealing from my claims?
Who dares to challenge me?
Who?
- (WIND WHISTLING)
- (PEOPLE CLAMORING)
You must be the Queen.
I saw your face on a coin.
You lost some ships.
You
You'd threaten me?
In my own court?
(GUARDS YELLING)
I'm not here for your throne.
The world is rich.
Richer than you could imagine.
But it is neither yours
nor mine to claim.
We believe our health
depends on your health.
Your magic doesn't scare me.
I was ordained to rule you.
And your people.
And it means that whatever I take,
whatever I claim
Put me down
Put me down! I order you!
(SCREAMS)
We will make peace.
Or there will be no future
for your people.
Kahhori and her people used the miracles
of the Sky World to bring
peace to their neighbors.
DR. STRANGE: Bravo.
THE WATCHER: But their greatest
battle has only just begun.
DR. STRANGE: World peace in
record time. I'm sure that'll last.
But I digress.
My name is Stephen Strange,
and I've been looking for you
for a long time.
