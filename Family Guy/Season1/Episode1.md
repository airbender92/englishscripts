The penis broke off while I was loading it into the car.
I shall call you "Eduardo.
" Peter, how can we afford this? You won't believe it, Mom! Dad's getting A big raise! Peter, that's wonderful! But, Dad, I thought The kind of raise that'll allow me to give my kids a big allowance just for keeping their big mouths shut.
Come on, guys.
I'll buy us the most expensive meal we've ever had.
Yeah.
I'd like 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas, please.
CLERK: I beg your pardon? And a "So-sage" McBiscuit, please.
Peter, what's the big surprise? You know how I always said you should be treated like a queen? I got you your own jester.
JESTER: Good to be here in New England.
And what's the deal with "New" England anyway? It's over 200 years old! Last time I checked, that's not that new.
This is great.
I can finally afford to give my little girl the lips she's always dreamed of.
MEG: Thank you, Daddy! [Kisses Peter.]
I don't know, Peter.
Lips are one thing.
But did you have to buy breast implants for Chris? It makes him happy.
These are cool.
MAILWOMAN: When did you get a pool? It's a moat.
I know it's silly but my husband thinks our family needs extra protection now that we're rich.
Does it work? It does keep the Black Knight at bay.
[Horse sputtering.]
Congratulations in all your success.
Here's your welfare check.
What the [Foghorn blowing.]
Hi, honey.
What? PETER: I know what I did was wrong.
But I only did it for you and the kids.
Except for the jukebox in the bathroom.
That was for Peter.
Yeah, from the American taxpayers.
I am so mad I can't see straight.
No problem.
We got money to get that fixed with enough left for us to buy our way out of any trouble our kids might get into.
Just like the Kennedys.
LOIS: I feel like I don't even know you anymore, Peter.
The man I married would never think he could fix a problem just by spending money! Boy, she's pretty pissed.
Who thought fraud would be one of her buttons? Why have a jukebox in the john if your wife's mad at you? Peter, you may have to return that money to the taxpayers.
But I gotta make sure Lois knows I'm doing it.
I need an event with thousands of people.
Something that everybody cares about.
We might have to leave Rhode Island for this.
ANNOUNCER: The air is electric here at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight! Pat, it's safe to say that all these fans came out here to watch a game of football! John, we're in commercial.
Yeah, I know.
I'm just making conversation.
Come on.
Football! Amazing.
You can barely drive a car.
Yet you were allowed to fly a blimp? Yeah, America's great, isn't it? Except for the South.
Boy, I hope Lois is watching.
Okay, taxpayers, here you go! PAT: Looks like we're getting some rain here tonight, John.
Yeah.
Hey, wait a second! This is no ordinary rain! It's some kind of crazy money rain! I'm being told it's a man and his dog throwing cash out of a blimp.
Man.
I hope this works.
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to start dropping these.
[People cheering.]
JOHN: The crowd is storming the field! This is pandemonium! Have you ever seen anything like this, Pat? Just once.
The 1975 Cotton Bowl.
This is the old "trying to make amends "for spending $150,000 a week in misappropriated welfare funds" play.
I don't care what it is! That guy's ruining a perfectly good game of football! - Madden to Fox Security.
- Go ahead.
JOHN: Take them down! GUARD: Yes, sir.
How was your shower? I tell you, all of the rumors about dropping the soap are true.
Really? You can't hold onto that thing to save your life.
It was slipping everywhere.
Guys were laughing.
GUY: There's the guy that couldn't hold the soap.
That was classic.
Boy.
I really let Lois down this time.
Do you think she'll wait for me? If every woman dumped her husband for crashing a blimp, no one would be married.
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I got the top bunk.
My collagen is wearing off.
Honey, sagging lips are just nature's way of telling you you shouldn't cover for your father's lie.
What does it mean when your armpits cry stinky tears? It means you're becoming a man.
But hopefully not the kind who stays out all day and doesn't call like your father who shall remain nameless.
STEWIE: Hello, Mother.
LOIS: Hi there, sweetie.
You know, Mother, life is like a box of chocolates.
You never know what you're going to get.
Your life, however, is more like a box of active grenades! [Dramatic instrumental music.]
STEWIE: Now, I offer one last chance for deliverance.
Return my mind-control device or be destroyed.
You just want your toy back.
Okay, here you go, honey.
Yes Well, victory is mine! [Explosion.]
STEWIE: Damn you all! [Phone ringing.]
[Phone ringing.]
Hello? Oh, my God! Lois, am I glad to see you.
I have nothing to say to you, Peter.
I gave the money back.
Why are you still steamed? Peter, you lied to me, you betrayed my trust.
Compared to that, welfare fraud doesn't even matter.
Really? Let's hope the judge feels that way.
This court will come to order.
I figured the sooner I cashed the check the sooner they'd catch their mistake.
Why are we making a federal case out of this? Don't you think you should have alerted the government of such a gross overpayment? I was gonna call them.
But my favorite episode of Different Strokes was on.
The one where Arnold and Dudley get sexually molested by the bike shop owner? All right.
Now I want you boys to scream real loud at my ass.
And everybody learns a valuable lesson.
Mr.
Griffin, have you learned a lesson? Yes.
Stay the hell away from that bike shop.
[People murmuring.]
Okay, everybody, I feel really bad about what I did.
I just I don't know.
I saw the one chance l'd ever have to give my family the things they deserve.
I guess I screwed it up.
I cheated the government.
And worst of all, I lied to my wife.
And she deserves better.
I'm sorry, honey.
Mr.
Griffin, I think your words have touched us all.
I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison.
No! - No! - No! No! Yeah! [Rock music.]
[Rock music stops abruptly.]
LOIS: Excuse me, Your Honor? JUDGE: Yes? Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times.
He may even be downright stupid.
But I know he only accepted that money because he wanted to be a good husband and father.
But what he needs to remember is that we love him.
And no matter what, I'll always stand by him.
I love you too, honey.
That was very moving, Mrs.
Griffin.
Okay, you can go to jail with him! What? Intolerable as it may be l'm completely dependent upon those wretched drones for sustenance.
Let us see how the constitution of American justice fares against the device! [Device pulsates.]
Is that your boy? What? Yeah.
That's Stewie.
Gosh.
I can't separate a kid that young from his father.
It's unjudgmenly.
- Hell, you've learned your lesson, right? - Yeah.
- All right.
You're free.
- Wow! Can you give me my job back? No.
- Yes.
- All right! [Cheery instrumental music.]
[Man laughing on TV.]
ED: That was a crazy one, Dick.
DICK: It sure was.
In this next blooper from Joanie Loves Chachi watch what happens when Scott Baio tries to say: "She sells seashells down by the seashore.
" What does your mom do? She sells seashells down by the That is kind of a tongue twister.
It's good to have you home, Peter.
Honey, I knew everything would turn out okay.
I sure am gonna miss being rich.
PETER: Don't worry.
I got a way to get money.
Not another welfare scam? No.
Minority scholarship.
[Giggles.]
[Jazzy instrumental music.]
LOIS AND BRIAN: No.
STEWIE: Are you insane? Okay, I mean sexual harassment suit.
[Giggles.]
BRIAN: No.
LOIS: Don't think so.
STEWIE: Absolutely outrageous.
Okay, disability claim.
[Theme music.]
